🏀 Bouncing Ball Simulation (Python + Pygame)

A simple 2D physics simulation of a ball bouncing within a window using Python and Pygame. The ball reacts to gravity and collisions with walls, demonstrating basic motion and energy loss.

🧠 Description

This project simulates a ball affected by gravity, bouncing off the ground and walls with realistic deceleration using friction and damping.

🎯 Features

Smooth ball movement using Vector2

Gravity simulation

Bounces with energy loss (damping)

Horizontal friction effect on each bounce

Scalable and easy to modify

📦 Requirements

Python 3.x

Pygame

Install using:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

▶️ How to Run

Make sure ball.png is in the same directory, then run:

```
python main.py
```
